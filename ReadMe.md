## PriceBot

A universal price finder for things, currently setup to work for automobiles only right now

Abstracted Sites:
- Craigslist
- Ebay
- AutoTempest


### Sample Runs

Look in the docs/samples folder for examples on how to use pricebot
This folder also contains sample outputs of gathered results

Easiest way is to install the requirements first
pip install -r requirements.txt

And then pip install pricebot (Not sure if doing just this line will install requirements?)
pip install -e .

And then move chromedriver.exe to PATH (or put it in c:\python27 assuming python is in your PATH already)
